Once upon a time, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife.
One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree, the kindhearted monkey 
offered him some fruits. The monkey and the crocodile became friends. The crocodile used to meet the monkey frequently.
